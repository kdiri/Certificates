## Certificates

This is a repository that has been created to store personal certificates and accomplishments of mine. 
Major websites that I follow are [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). 
I also rarely use [edx](https://www.edx.org/) and [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) to learn new things.
