## Certificates

This repository has been created to store personal certificates and accomplishments. 
Principal websites that I follow are [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). 
I rarely use also [edx](https://www.edx.org/) and [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) to learn new things.
